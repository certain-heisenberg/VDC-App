5) Initialize Amplify using ```amplify init```, then push to AWS cloud using ```amplify push```.
6) Start the development server using ```npx react-native start```.
7) Finally run ```npx react-native run-android``` or ```npx react-native run-ios``` based on the Operating System of mobile device and wait for build to finish.

Voil√† now you have the App installed and running on your device.

If you want to make changes to this App using your development server, you need
to connect your device with development server. See ```Connecting to the development server``` section in [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device)
